This assignment does not include any particularly complicated logic or algorithms, 
but it will require you to organize your code well and make effective use of the C 
language and libraries. You will also have to explore the details of the C string 
and file I/O libraries to discover how to do various operations that should already 
be familiar from your programming experience in other languages, but which are 
different in C. It is meant as an orientation to the Unix/Linux C programming environment. 
You should do this assignment by yourself.

The material that we have learned in lecture is not enough to complete this assignment. 
It is expected that you will investigate the resources and libraries mentioned in this 
document to learn about how to use them.
